## Sikai Ruan

I’m Sikai Ruan, a fourth year undergraduate student in School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University. I’m currently advised by Prof. Yuqing Kong. I’m also pleased to have worked with Prof. Lirong Xia in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute during my undergraduate years.

My research interest lies in the intersection of theoretical computer science and economics: information elicitation/aggregation, peer prediction, mechanism design, and algorithmic game theory.

I’m currently applying for PhD (Fall 2021).
